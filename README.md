# Disco Maze

The world's wildest disco party is taking place on the rooftop of an eight-story building. The doors are closing soon, and you don't have a ticket, but impressing the bouncers with your dance moves may grant you passage to the next floor. Strangely, each floor resembles a maze, with dance tutorials located on every level, and the hallways are too narrow for two people to pass each other.

This is a 1-4 players game made in 10 days for the React Jam of August 2023.

Results: 2nd place of the multiplayer challenge ([link](https://summer-2023.reactjam.com/winners))
