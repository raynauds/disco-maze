# Disco Maze

The world's wildest disco party is taking place on the rooftop of an eight-story building. The doors are closing soon, and you don't have a ticket, but impressing the bouncers with your dance moves may grant you passage to the next floor. Strangely, each floor resembles a maze, with dance tutorials located on every level, and the hallways are too narrow for two people to pass each other.
